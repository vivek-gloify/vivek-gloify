👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Kumar Yadav, I build value through design and development.

Originally hailing from the India 🇮🇳  for the last many years I’ve been honing my skills in design and development, production and management roles building products for the web, mobile, and, more recently .

I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.

I’ve worked with small, agile teams on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product lifecycles spanning multiple years.

Depending on the team, resources and deliverables I’ve worn many hats over the years - holding titles like Product Designer, UI Designer, UX Designer, Front-end Developer, Growth Lead, Producer, Product Manager & Product Owner.

I also occasionally give talks on design and product development.
